            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is John McCauley (but I prefer to go by Jack), and I am an aspiring developer actively learning the craft from square one. The going is rough at the moment, but by the time any potential employers see this I hope to have edited that bit out with confidence. Since you are reviewing this for a grade, I hope my sense of humor helps me out here. Some fun facts about me are that I have great taste in music and terrible taste in sports teams (go Bears). I moved from Tucson to Dallas for work this summer, and promptly lost my job upon arriving due to pandemic related downsizing (this will also be edited out). I am now virtually attending a full stack coding bootcamp through Trilogy Education and the University of Arizona, and I look forward to filling this page with all of the cool things I will make along the way. </p>

<!-- ## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
``` -->

<!-- ## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
``` -->
